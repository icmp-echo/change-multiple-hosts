# change-multiple-hosts
commit a change or set of commands to multiple host with few edits
just gather the list of host & command(s) & username-pass to change with and good to go

let me know if any questions.
p.s. if you get ssh error check if you have "requested strict checking" enabled. 
or try ssh-keygen -R "hostname" 
                     and "ip"
