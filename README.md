# change-multiple-hosts
commit a change or set of commands to multiple hosts with few edits
just gather the list of hosts & command(s) & username-pass to change with and good to go

let me know if any questions.
# p.s. if you get ssh error check if you have "requested strict checking" enabled. 
# or try ssh-keygen -R "hostname" 
#        ssh-keygen -R "ip"
